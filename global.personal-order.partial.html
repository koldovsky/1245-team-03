            alt="The image shows a man sitting on a high stool. He is wearing a white short-sleeved T-shirt and light blue jeans that are rolled up at the ankles. He has brown leather shoes on his feet. The man looks to the side and raised his head slightly, as if thinking or posing for a photo. With one hand he holds a brown leather bag that lies on the floor at his feet. The background of the image is light, almost white, which emphasizes the man and his clothes. The left side of the image is empty, possibly for text or other design elements.">
